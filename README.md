# 📧 Spam Detection Mails Prediction

A Machine Learning project to **detect whether an email is Spam or Not (Ham)** using Python and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The core model is trained on an email dataset to learn patterns in text that help distinguish spam from legitimate emails.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Email spam is unsolicited content sent in bulk that can clutter inboxes, contain scams, phishing attempts, or malware links. This project implements a spam classification system that:

- Loads and explores an email dataset (`email.csv`)
- Preprocesses text using NLP techniques
- Trains a machine learning model to classify emails
- Evaluates performance using accuracy and confusion matrix

This project is developed using a **Jupyter Notebook** (`Spam_detection1.ipynb`). :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
